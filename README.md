Q-less solver by Indy and Emerson

**Plan**
- Pick letters randomly from the set of 12 dice
- Algorithm to take in letters and generate all possible starting words
- Then use some sort of DFS to search for 2nd words
- Once we have sets of possible words that can be made from those letters, can we put them together in a board?

**Goals**
- Is this set solvable?
- How many ways are there to solve this set?
- What are those ways?

**Extensions**
- Letter classifier so that we can input image of dice and then get the below outputs
- Board visualizer of possible outputs
- Find a set of dice that maximizes probability that a roll is solvable
